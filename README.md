# Introduction
The first Ethereum token that is fundamentally built to “swing”.

Tokens are either minted or burned block by block in accordance to the target price of the token. The higher the price the higher the mint (cap of 10% per sell tx) the lower the price the higher the burn:

530 SWING/ETH - 320 SWING/ETH

If the price of Swingy surpasses 320 SWING per ETH the protocol begins to mint tokens.

If the price of Swingy is below 530 SWING per ETH the protocol begins to burn tokens. 

Minted tokens are distributed to liquidity providers in the Seesaw for further distribution.
